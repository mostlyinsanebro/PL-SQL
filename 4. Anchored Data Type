Anchored datatypes are those datatypes which we assign to a variable based on a db object.

var_name types_attribute%type;

We use anchored data types in case the the column from whih we are fetching data gets modified. In that case, the harcoded datatype and 
size can end up breaking the code, using anchored datatype enables it for dynamic changes.

Example:-
DECLARE
    v_name ES_USER.XXAB_ABHI_TUT.name%type;
BEGIN
    SELECT name 
    INTO v_name
    FROM ES_USER.XXAB_ABHI_TUT
    WHERE id = 1;
    dbms_output.put_line(v_name);
END;
