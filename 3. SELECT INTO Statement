We can give value to our variable by fetching data from a table in db using Select Into statement.

The datatype and size of the variable that will store the data coming from a column of a table should be same or greater to that of the column 
from which the data will be fetched.

Example:-
DECLARE

v_id  NUMBER;
v_desc VARCHAR2(100);
BEGIN

SELECT id,description 
INTO v_id,v_desc
from es_user.xxab_abhi_test
where id = 4;

dbms_output.put_line(v_id||' has description '||v_desc);
END;
