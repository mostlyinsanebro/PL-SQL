PL/SQL stands for Procedural SQL.
Blocks are basic programming units in PL/SQL.

There are 2 types of blocks in PL/SQL -> 1.Anonymous Block   2. Named Block.

Each block is divided into 3 sections:-

i). DECLARATION Section (optional)

ii). EXECUTION SECTION (mandatory)

iii). EXCEPTION-hANDLING Section (optional)

------------- PL/SQL Block example --------------------
DECLARE

BEGIN

EXCEPTION  

END;
--------------------------------------------------------
i). Declaration Section:- This section is optional and all the identifiers like variables, cursors, constants etc. are declared/defined here.

ii). Execution Section:- This section contains the executable statements that allow us to manipulate the variables that were declared in declaration 
      section. It is a mandatory section and contains DML Commands and SQL_PLUS built-in functions.
	  *SQL-Plus is simply a tool (command line utility) that is installed in our system once we install Oracle database in our system.
	  DDL Commands can also be written using NDS ( Native Dynamic SQL) or DBMS_SQL built-in functions.
	
iii). Exception Block is used to handle the exceptions that may occur in the execution section.
